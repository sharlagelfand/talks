# TTC Delays

---

How did this "Unauthorized at track level" delay vary from line to line?

What are the other main causes of delays?

2018 TTC delays available from [Toronto Open Data](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/transportation/#917dd033-1fe5-4ba8-04ca-f683eec89761).

Let's answer some of my questions and go over some strategies about how to work with a new data set.

---

```{r delays-raw, include=FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank()))

delays_clean <- fs::dir_ls("delays") %>%
  purrr::map_dfr(readxl::read_excel) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

delay_codes <- readxl::read_excel("Subway & SRT Log Codes.xlsx") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

delay_codes <- delay_codes %>%
  select(code = sub_rmenu_code, description = code_description_3) %>%
  bind_rows(
    delay_codes %>%
      select(code = srt_rmenu_code,
             description = code_description_7)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(code))

delays_clean <- delays_clean %>%
  left_join(delay_codes) %>%
  select(date, time, station, code, description, min_delay, bound, line)

delays <- delays_clean %>%
  mutate(min_delay = ifelse(row_number() %in% sample(1:nrow(delays_clean), nrow(delays_clean)*0.05), NA_integer_, min_delay),
         date = as.Date(date)) %>%
  filter(!(line %in% c("BLOOR DANFORTH LINES", "YONGE UNIVERSITY SERVI")))
```

```{r delays}
head(delays)
```

--

Some qualities of this data were doctored (by me) for the purpose of Making A Point.

---

Top 5 causes for delay along each line (YU, BD, SHP, and SRT).

```{r delays-analysis, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

delays %>%
  group_by(line, code) %>%
  summarise(delays = sum(min_delay)) %>%
  arrange(-delays) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = code,
             y = delays)) +
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(line), 
             scales = "free_y",
             nrow = 4) +
  coord_flip()
```

---

```{r delays-analysis-output, ref.label="delays-analysis", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.asp=0.60}
```

Immediate issues -- other "lines", inconsistent coding.

---

```{r delays-main-lines, eval=FALSE}
delays %>%
  filter(line %in% c("YU", "YU", 
                     "SHP", "SRT")) %>% 
  ... same code as before
```

```{r delays-main-lines-output, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.45}
delays %>%
  filter(line %in% c("BD", "YU", 
                     "SHP", "SRT")) %>% 
  group_by(line, description) %>%
  summarise(delays = sum(min_delay)) %>%
  arrange(-delays) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = description,
             y = delays)) +
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(line), 
             scales = "free_x",
             nrow = 1) +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank())
```

--

Where's "Unauthorized at Track Level?"

---

Look at delay from campaign, "Unauthorized at Track Level"

--

```{r suut-delays-na, eval=FALSE}
delays %>%
  filter(description == "Unauthorized at Track Level") %>%
  group_by(line) %>%
  summarise(delays = sum(min_delay))
```

--

```{r suut-delays-na-output, ref.label="suut-delays-na", echo=FALSE}
```

--

Easy to remove `NA`s, but lurking consequences -- top 5 delays are wrong now too (any delays with `NA` wouldn't be considered).

Some issues don't raise red flags, which is the worst of all.

# Strategies for working with new data

How can you avoid this back and forth?

Nicer to know *what* kind of issues you'll have to handle.

Not reliant on "doing something with a specific variable" to spot an issue with it.

# `r emo::ji("mag")` Visual summaries `r emo::ji("mag")`

# `visdat` package

Visual overview of data structure and missingness, created by [Nick Tierney](https://www.njtierney.com/).

--

```{r visdat-delays, eval=FALSE}
library(visdat)

vis_dat(delays)
```

```{r visdat-delays-output, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.asp=0.50}
library(visdat)

delays %>%
  vis_dat() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0))
```

Learn things about your data that weren't clear in the first few lines.

---

# `visdat` package

```{r vismiss-delays, eval=FALSE}
vis_miss(delays)
```

```{r vismiss-delays-output, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.asp=0.50}
delays %>%
  vis_miss() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0))
```

--

What does it *mean* if `bound` is missing? Both directions? Specific `code`s?

---

# Variable summaries

Attributes and possible values of each variable.

--

```{r summary-min-delay, eval=FALSE}
summary(delays[["min_delay"]])
```

--

```{r summary-min-delay, ref.label="summary-min-delay", echo=FALSE}
```

--

```{r summary-line, eval = FALSE}
summary(delays[["line"]])
```

--

```{r summary-line-output, ref.label="summary-line", echo=FALSE}
```

--

`summary()` is very general. Sometimes it contains good information, sometimes it doesn't tell you anything at all.

---

# `skimr` package

Gives summary statistics that you can quickly *skim* to understand your data, maintained by [Elin Waring](https://elinwaring.org/) and [Michael Quinn](http://michaelquinn32.github.io/).

--

Conforms to the principle of least surprise:

* Design should match the user's experience, expectations, and mental models.

--

* If it doesn't, you should find out quickly!

--

Good way to develop a mental model if you *don't* have one.

---

```{r delays-skim, eval=FALSE}
library(skimr)

skim(delays)
```

--

```{r delays-skim-output, ref.label="delays-skim", echo=FALSE}
```

--

The results are surprising, but good to know *now* instead of post iffy analysis.

---

# `skimr` package

What are the different values of `bound`, for each `line`?


```{r skim-delays-bound-line, eval=FALSE}
delays %>%
  filter(line %in% c("BD", "YU", "SHP", "SRT")) %>%
  mutate(bound = as.factor(bound)) %>%
  group_by(line) %>%
  skim(bound)
```

--

```{r skim-delays-bound-line-output, echo=FALSE, ref.label="skim-delays-bound-line"}
```

---
# Visual summaries

Highlight inconsistencies, indicate areas for further investigation.

Reliant on a person (you) looking at output.

(And remembering what you're looking for).

(And not leaving the project or your job).

# `r emo::ji("speaking_head")` Opinionated strategies `r emo::ji("speaking_head")` 

Codify assumptions so that your analysis fails if they're not met.

---

# `assertr` package

Verify assumptions about data *early* in a pipeline. Created by [Tony Fischetti](http://www.onthelambda.com/).

Forces you to outline assumptions about data, and alerts you of any deviations.

Can help save you from the case where an analysis "look okay" but produces inaccurate results.

---
layout:true
# `assertr` package

---

Use `assert()` for assumptions about columns of a data set.

Throws an error and stops execution if the assumptions are violated.

Returns original data set if assumptions are met.

--

Let's say I assume `line` is YU, BD, SHP, or SRT.

```{r assert-line, eval=FALSE}
library(assertr)

delays %>%
  assert(in_set("YU", "BD", "SHP", "SRT"), line)
```

--

```{r assert-line-output, error=TRUE, ref.label="assert-line", echo=FALSE}
```

---

--

`in_set("YU", "BD", "SHP", "SRT")` says that the subject, `line`, only has values in the set "YU", "BD", "SHP", "SRT".

---

`in_set()`: checks that each value is within a set.

--

`within_bounds()`: checks that each numeric value is within the bounds

```{r min-delay-positive, eval=FALSE}
delays %>%
  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), min_delay)
```

--

```{r min-delay-positive-out, error=TRUE, echo=FALSE, ref.label = "min-delay-positive"}
```

---

`not_na()`: checks that each element is not NA.

```{r, error=TRUE}
delays %>%
  assert(not_na, min_delay)
```

--

`is_uniq()`: checks if each value is unique; useful for IDs.

--

DIY! write a function that returns TRUE/FALSE.

---

`assertr` functions are designed to be piped together.

By default, the first deviation will stop the pipe and return errors.

--

```{r assert-chain-fail, eval=FALSE}
delays %>%
  assert(in_set("YU", "BD", "SHP", "SRT"), line) %>%
  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), min_delay) %>%
  assert(not_na, min_delay)
```

--

```{r assert-chain-fail-outout, echo=FALSE, error=TRUE, ref.label="assert-chain-fail"}
```

Only names one violation.

---

Use `chain_start()` and `chain_end()` to get all errors.

--

```{r assert-chain, error=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
delays %>%
  chain_start() %>%
  assert(in_set("YU", "BD", "SHP", "SRT"), line) %>%
  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), min_delay) %>%
  assert(not_na, min_delay) %>%
  chain_end()
```

--

```{r assert-chain-outout, echo=FALSE, error=TRUE, ref.label="assert-chain"}
```


---

When all assumptions are satisfied, the result is just the original data set.

It can be piped directly for analysis. 

--

```{r, include=FALSE}
delays_clean <- delays_clean %>%
  mutate(line_clean = case_when(line %in% c("BD", "B/D", 
                                            "BLOOR DANFORTH LINES") ~ "BD",
                                line %in% c("YU", "YUS",
                                            "YONGE UNIVERSITY SERVI") ~ "YU",
                                line == "SHP" ~ "SHP",
                                line == "SRT" ~ "SRT")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(line_clean),
         !is.na(min_delay)) %>%
  select(-line, line = line_clean)
```

```{r assumptions-met-plot, eval=FALSE}
delays_clean %>% 
  chain_start() %>%
  assert(in_set("YU", "BD", "SHP", "SRT"), line) %>%
  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), min_delay) %>%
  assert(not_na, min_delay) %>%
  chain_end() %>%
  group_by(line, description) %>%
  summarise(delays = sum(min_delay)) %>%
  arrange(-delays) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = description,
             y = delays)) +
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(line), 
             scales = "fixed",
             nrow = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

---

```{r asumptions-met-plot-output, echo=FALSE, ref.label="assumptions-met-plot", out.width="100%", fig.asp=0.55}
```

# Wrapping up

`r emo::ji("swim")` Be weary of diving right into results.

`r emo::ji("mag")` Efficiently visualize your data to verify or build mental models.

`r emo::ji("hole")` Be liberal with rabbit holes, investigations, and edge cases.

`r emo::ji("speaking_head")` Codify your assumptions so that it is them, not you, who fail spectacularly!
