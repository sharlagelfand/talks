# Some questions to ask yourself...

### 1. What do I want my data to look like when I go to use it?
### 2. What does it look like now?
### 3. How do I get there, and how do I know what I'm doing is right?
### 4. How can I be as lazy as possible?

####  Which ridings changed parties between 2015 and 2019? What were the changes?

Elected parties, by riding:

* A list of all ridings in Canada
* Which party won in that riding in 2015
* Which party won in that riding in 2019

## 2015 Election Results

[42nd General Election: Official Voting Results (Voting Results by Electoral District)](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/775f3136-1aa3-4854-a51e-1a2dab362525)

```{r}
ridings_results_2015_raw
```

---

## 2015 Election Results

```{r}
library(dplyr)

ridings_results_2015 <- ridings_results_2015_raw %>%
  select(
    `Electoral District Name/Nom de circonscription`,
    `Elected Candidate/Candidat élu`
  )

head(ridings_results_2015)
```

--

Riding name contains English and French. Elected party is contained within elected candidate field.

---

## 2019 Election Results

[October 21, 2019 Federal Election Election Results](https://enr.elections.ca/National.aspx?lang=e)

```{r}
ridings_results_2019_raw
```

---

## 2019 Election Results

```{r}
ridings_results_2019 <- ridings_results_2019_raw %>%
  select(
    `Electoral district`,
    `Political affiliation`
  )

ridings_results_2019
```

English riding name only, political party is available on its own.

# How do I get there? How do I know what I'm doing is right?

## Make a plan. Take things slowly. Check your answers!

---

## We have...

2015 data: a list of ridings (English and French names together) and which official was elected (with their political affiliation in the same field)

2019 data: a list of ridings (English name only) and which political party was elected

--

## We want...

A list of all ridings and which party won in 2015 and 2019
---

## Game plan:

`r emo::ji("black_medium_square")` Make the data easier to work with

--

`r emo::ji("black_medium_square")` Extract the English riding name from the 2015 data

--

`r emo::ji("black_medium_square")` Ensure the ridings names from the two data sets match

--

`r emo::ji("black_medium_square")` Extract the elected party from the 2015 elected official

--

`r emo::ji("black_medium_square")` Combine the two data sets

---

## Make the data easier to work with

```{r}
names(ridings_results_2019)
```

--

```{r, error = TRUE}
# ridings_results_2019 %>%
#   select(Electoral district)
```

--

```{r}
ridings_results_2019 %>%
  select(`Electoral district`)
```

---

## Make the data easier to work with

The [`janitor` package]() is totally `r emo::ji("bomb")` for cleaning data.

```{r}
library(janitor)

ridings_results_2015 <- ridings_results_2015 %>%
  clean_names()

ridings_results_2019 <- ridings_results_2019 %>%
  clean_names()
```

--

```{r}
names(ridings_results_2019)
```

--

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Make the data easier to work with

---

## Get the English riding name out of the 2015 data

```{r}
library(tidyr)

ridings_results_2015 <- ridings_results_2015 %>%
  separate(electoral_district_name_nom_de_circonscription,
    into = "riding",
    sep = "/"
  )
```

--

```{r}
ridings_results_2015
```


--

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Extract the English riding name from the 2015 data

---

## Ensure the riding names match

```{r}
ridings_results_2015 <- ridings_results_2015 %>%
  arrange(riding)

ridings_results_2019 <- ridings_results_2019 %>%
  rename(riding = electoral_district) %>%
  arrange(riding)

all(ridings_results_2015[["riding"]] == ridings_results_2019[["riding"]])
```

--

```{r}
ridings_results_2015 %>%
  select(riding_2015 = riding) %>%
  bind_cols(ridings_results_2019 %>%
              select(riding_2019 = riding)) %>%
  filter(riding_2015 != riding_2019)
```

--

`r emo::ji("x")` Ensure the ridings names from the two data sets match

---

## Ensure the riding names match

Replace all "--" with "-"

```{r}
library(stringr)

ridings_results_2015 <- ridings_results_2015 %>%
  mutate(riding = str_replace_all(riding, "--", "-")) %>%
  arrange(riding)

ridings_results_2019 <- ridings_results_2019 %>%
  mutate(riding = str_replace_all(riding, "--", "-")) %>%
  arrange(riding)

all(ridings_results_2015[["riding"]] == ridings_results_2019[["riding"]])
```

--

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Ensure the ridings names from the two data sets match

---

## Get the elected party out of the elected official

```{r}
ridings_results_2015 %>%
  select(elected_candidate_candidat_elu)
```

---

## Get the elected party out of the elected official

Getting the party name in French would be easy - everything after the slash

```{r}
ridings_results_2015 %>%
  separate(
    elected_candidate_candidat_elu,
    into = c("candidate_and_english_party", "french_party"),
    sep = "/"
  ) %>%
  count(french_party)
```

Not as easy in English - party names are not just the word before the slash.

---

## Get the elected party out of the elected official

I'm not above manual recoding!

```{r}
ridings_results_2015 <- ridings_results_2015 %>%
  mutate(party = case_when(
    str_detect(elected_candidate_candidat_elu, "Conservative") ~ "Conservative",
    str_detect(elected_candidate_candidat_elu, "NDP") ~ "NDP",
    str_detect(elected_candidate_candidat_elu, "Liberal") ~ "Liberal",
    str_detect(elected_candidate_candidat_elu, "Bloc Québécois") ~ "Bloc Québécois",
    str_detect(elected_candidate_candidat_elu, "Green Party") ~ "Green Party"
  )) %>%
  select(-elected_candidate_candidat_elu)

head(ridings_results_2015)
```

---

## Get the elected party out of the elected official

Check that all values have been recoded

```{r}
ridings_results_2015 %>%
  count(party)
```

--

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Extract the elected party from the 2015 elected official

---

## Combine the 2015 and 2019 results

```{r}
ridings_results_2019 <- ridings_results_2019 %>%
  rename(party = political_affiliation)

riding_results <- ridings_results_2015 %>%
  full_join(ridings_results_2019,
    by = "riding",
    suffix = c("_2015", "_2019")
  )

riding_results
```

--

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Combine the two data sets

---

## Combine the 2015 and 2019 results

### Expectations

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data.svg")
```

### Reality

```{r}
head(riding_results)
```

---

## What have we accomplished?

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Make the data easier to work with

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Extract the English riding name from the 2015 data

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Ensure the ridings names from the two data sets match

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Extract the elected party from the 2015 elected official

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Combine the two data sets

# What question did we want to answer?

---

## How many ridings elected a different party in 2019 than they did in 2015?

```{r}
different_parties <- riding_results %>%
  filter(party_2015 != party_2019)

different_parties
```

---

## How many ridings elected a different party in 2019 than they did in 2015?

```{r}
library(glue)

different_parties <- different_parties %>%
  mutate(party_change = glue("{party_2015} to {party_2019}"))

different_parties["party_change"]
```

---

## How many ridings elected a different party in 2019 than they did in 2015?

```{r}
different_parties %>%
  tabyl(party_change) %>%
  arrange(-percent) %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting()
```

# What have we covered?

### `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` What do I want my data to look like when I go to use it?
### `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` What does it look like now?
### `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` How do I get there, and how do I know what I'm doing is right?
### `r emo::ji("x")` How can I be as lazy as possible?

---

## How can I be as lazy as possible?

--

### Reduce friction!

--

Clean your column names

--

Optimize for human readability

--

If there's an easy way, take it (no one is handing out medals for figuring out regular expressions)

--

Consider alternative methods (`separate` versus regex)

--

Use packages that already exist. Keep up with what's out there ([rweekly.org](rweekly.org))
